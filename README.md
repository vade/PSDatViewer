# PSDatViewer
Previews Adobe Photoshop DAT resource files -  which have images concatenated back to back.


A long story short, but if you ever want to view, or edit Photoshop cursor icons, or tool icons, etc, you can preview them here, and eventually find the locations within the DAT File.

Find the DAT files located within Photoshop.app/Contents/Resources/ as PSIconsHighRes.dat and PSIconsLowRes.dat

Photoshop does not like you tampering with the DAT resource files, and checks if the byte size of the file has changed.

If you plan on making edits, make sure you do not change the resulting size of the file.
